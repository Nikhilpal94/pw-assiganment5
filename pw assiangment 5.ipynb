This private heap is taken care of by Python Interpreter itself, and a programmer doesn’t have access to this private heap. Python memory manager takes care of the allocation of Python private heap space. Memory for Python private heap space is made available by Python’s in-built garbage collector, which recycles and frees up all the unused memory. The allocation of heap space for Python objects and other internal buffers is performed on demand by the Python memory manager through the Python/C API functions listed in this document. To avoid memory corruption, extension writers should never try to operate on Python objects with the functions exported by the C library: malloc(), calloc(), realloc() and free()."
